## Capstone Overview

### Project Title  
**RemindMeh! – A Frontend Reminder App**

---

### Project Idea and Brief Description

**RemindMeh!** is a modern, minimalistic reminder and habit-tracking app built entirely on the frontend using React and Next.js.  
The goal of this project is to help users create daily reminders, track them visually, and stay consistent using check-ins and streaks — all while maintaining a clean, responsive user interface.

No backend is used; instead, the app uses `localStorage` to persist user data in the browser.  
This capstone project showcases core frontend development skills: state management, component architecture, local data persistence, and responsive design.
